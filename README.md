## How it works

Clone the repo and run the program with the command `ng serve` for a dev server to start.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Write text in the text are and click **SAVE** to get a html preview of the program

## Limitations
The program cannot make multiple lines on HTML preview. All the rendered markdown is on one line.
